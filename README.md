# BNN Wildfire Workspace
A hybrid notebook codespace environment designed to co-host a number of functionalities for a Geomatics MSc. thesis:

 * Note-taking in markdown: `/notes`
 * Code & experiments
 * Documentation and Reporting

 The official typst template in `/thesis` was adapted from a template: https://github.com/tudelft3d/msc_geomatics_thesis_typst.git

Best used in VS-Code with the additions of these extensions:
* `Foam`: Rendering, wiki-linking and graph-view of markdown files
* `Tinymist`: Implementation of typst functionality
